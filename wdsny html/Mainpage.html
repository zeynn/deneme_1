You can design and create, and build the most wonderful place in the world.<br>
 But it takes people to make the dream a reality." - Walt Disney<br> 


Combining masterful artistry and storytelling with groundbreaking technology, Walt Disney Animation Studios is a filmmaker-driven animation studio responsible<br> 
for creating some of the most beloved films ever made. Located in Burbank, WDAS continues to build on its rich legacy of innovation and creativity, stretching <br> 
from the first fully-animated feature film, 1937's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, to 2013's Academy Award®-winning Frozen, the biggest animated film of all time.<br>
 Among the studio's timeless creations are Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, The Jungle Book, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Big Hero 6,<br>
 Zootopia, and the upcoming feature Moana..<br>


Here at Walt Disney Animation Studios, employees continually enhance their development, learning, and creative growth through a wide variety of classes, from <br>
custome drawing instruction by our own artists, to seminars on film making techniques by masters of the craft, to technological demonstrations from in-house experts.<br> 
Maintaining a work-life balance is important and we’ve created an environment that reflects that philosophy. In short, our people make our films great, and<br>
 we strive to build a culture that feeds and respects the creative spirit.</th>
